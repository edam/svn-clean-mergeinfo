=head1 NAME

svn-clean-mergeinfo.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Command line tool to consolidate C<svn:mergeinfo> properties to the root branch
node (C</trunk/> or C</branches/X.Y/>) and clean safely properties set on
sub-folders in a working copy tree.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item C<svn-clean-mergeinfo.pl [--debug] [--verbose] [--nowrite]>

consolidates C<svn:mergeinfo> properties in a Subversion working copy to the root
node. If the option C<--nowrite> is enabled, consolidated properties are not
written to the working copy but only reported as a summary.


=item C<svn-clean-mergeinfo.pl --status>

prints a summary of C<svn:mergeinfo> properties content as numbers of merged
revisions for each branch.

=head1 OPERATION

This script must be invoked from a Subversion working copy directory, usually a checkout of /trunk or of a branch.

First it parses C<svn:mergeinfo> and scans for branch/revisions on non-root
folders.

If a revision is already included at the root node level, it is discarded from
sub-folders.

If a revision only modifies files included in the scan sub-folder, it is discarded from the sub-folder and appended at root level.

In some cases, a branch name is non consistent with the current node name, so
it is left as-is for a manual check if the revision content was partially
merged or not.

After the operation and without C<--nowrite> option, the working copy
C<svn:mergeinfo> are modified so that you can inspect the result before a
commit. If the svn:mergeinfo property is empty, it is planned for removal.

This script does not trigger a Subversion commit to the repository. That
operation is under your responsability after manual checks and validations.

It finally reports a summary of C<svn:mergeinfo> properties content as numbers
of merged revisions for each branch.
